                    Be the part of online shopping
                    Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or
                    services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a
                    product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among
                    alternative vendors using a shopping search engine,
                    <br> which displays the same product's availability
                    and pricing at different e-retailers.
                    <br> As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of
                    different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and
                    smartphones.
                    <br>

                    An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular
                    "bricks-and-mortar" retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C)
                    online shopping.
                    <br> When an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another......
                    Website Creating..
                    Devlopment is a very brilliant work...

                    Web Designing
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of
                    websites.
                    <br>

                    The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI
                    design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX
                    <br>
                    design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering
                    different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term
                    "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side)
                    design of a website including writing markup.
                    <br> Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the
                    broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and
                    be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

                <h2>Web Devlopment</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                    intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static
                    page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.
                    <br> A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
                    engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
                    Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
                    <br>

                    Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building
                    Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to
                    make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. <br>

                    For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people
                    (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.
                    Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
                    assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician.
                    <br> Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a
                    designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer,
                    back-end developer, and full-stack developer.
                    <br>[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
                    while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim
                    Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of
                    the most used technologies ever.

                    At first sight, website design to a viewer appears to be the visuals seen on a web page. But the
                    fact is that a whole gamut of techniques and skills are involved in creating a web page design to
                    give it the desired look. So, web design is about deciding on a lot of elements such as the layout,
                    graphics, colors, fonts, structure, content, text styles, interactive features, imagery, interface,
                    standardized code, etc.

                <p>
                    Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetics, clothing construction and natural beauty
                    to clothing and its accessories. It is influenced by culture and different trends, and has varied
                    over time and place. "A fashion designer creates clothing, including dresses, suits, pants, and
                    skirts, and accessories like shoes and handbags, for consumers. He or she can specialize in
                    clothing, accessory, or jewelry design, or may work in more than one of these areas.
